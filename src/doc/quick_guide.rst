After edbc is installed, it already provides a basic configuration that should be suitable for all needs. In this chapter
we explain how to perform a few common tasks without going to much into detail.

Setting up the database connection
==================================

If you need to change the database connection (although it can be defined in the ./configure flags) go to the etc/conf.d/database.cfg
file. The values should be self-explanatory, but are discussed in detail in :ref:`datasource-ref`.
